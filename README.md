# rock_paper_scissors
My first project in Javascript! This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game based in the console with no GUI for the first version. This program uses simple JavaScript to allow a user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. 

Enhancements I would like to make in the future:
- Error handling
- Adding GUI
